# feat(orchestrator): extract end-to-end pipeline and refactor Streamlit UI to single-call flow

- Add rbidp/orchestrator.py with run_pipeline(...) (no Streamlit deps)
- Centralize error codes and RU messages in rbidp/core/errors.py
- Always produce meta/final_result.json with {run_id, verdict, errors, checks?, artifacts}
- Write/maintain meta/manifest.json and key artifact paths
- Move GPT schema checks and error mapping into orchestrator
- Update app.py to save upload to temp, call run_pipeline once, and render final card
- Replace stop-on-error with uniform final result; add downloads for final_result.json, merged.json, validation.json
- Ensure artifacts.final_result_path is always present

Demo UX:
- Business testers get a consistent verdict + errors, with diagnostics in expander
- Local runs/ storage preserved (no MinIO)

Refs: MVP Option B design (clean UI + reusable orchestrator)

Test:
- streamlit run app.py
- Upload PDF/JPG/PNG and provide fio/reason/doc_type
- Verify final card, error list, and downloads; inspect runs/<date>/<run_id>/meta/final_result.json
